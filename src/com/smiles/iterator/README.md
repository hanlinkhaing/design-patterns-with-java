# Iterator Pattern

Use the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to hide its complexity from clients.

Use the pattern to reduce duplication of the traversal code across your app.

Use the pattern when you want your code to be able to traverse different data structure or when types of these structures are unknown beforehand.
