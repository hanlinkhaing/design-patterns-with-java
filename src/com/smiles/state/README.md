#State Pattern

Use the state pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently.

Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the class's fields.

Use the pattern when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-base state machine.
